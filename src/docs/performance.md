# Eleventy Performance

Eleventy is known for both its lightweight core in the form of speedy installs/builds and lightweight site output in the form of speedy sites!

## Site Performance

Eleventy allows you full control over the output. That also means that by-default we do not include any costly runtime JavaScript bundles that often hamper site performance!

{% callout "", "md" %}Have a look at our new [Partial Hydration `<is-land>` component](/docs/plugins/partial-hydration/)!{% endcallout %}

Sites listed on the [Eleventy Leaderboards](/speedlify/) are tested and ranked (approximately) monthly as a fun community way to maintain speedy site performance for Eleventy sites.

* Want to [add your site to the Leaderboards](/docs/leaderboards-add/)?

## Build Performance

**Eleventy offers best-in-class build performance for JavaScript site generators.**

### Performance Tips

* You can analyze your [project‚Äôs specific build performance metrics using Debug Mode](/docs/debug-performance/).
* The [Directory Output plugin](/docs/plugins/directory-output/) will also report per-template performance and file size information.
* Take [passthrough copy out of your build-loop with the Eleventy Dev Server](/docs/copy/#emulate-passthrough-copy-during-serve).
