# Incremental Builds

Incremental builds via the command line flag `--incremental` perform a partial build operating only on files that have changed to improve build times when doing local development.

Letâ€™s check in on the current capabilities and the roadmap:

- **Templates**
  - If you create/update a template file, Eleventy will run the build for that file and only that file.
  - **Layouts** {% addedin "2.0.0-canary.21" %}
    - When you change a layout file, any templates using that layout file are rebuilt.
  - **Template Dependencies** {% addedin "2.0.0-canary.19" %}Any templates using a dependency mapped via [the `addDependencies` method](/docs/languages/custom/#registering-dependencies) will be rebuilt when those dependencies change.
    - {% addedin "1.0.0" %}This feature was previously exposed as part of the API for [Custom template extensions](/docs/languages/custom/#isincrementalmatch) via the `isIncrementalMatch` function.
    - **Other Includes**: If the created/updated file is in your [Includes](/docs/config/#directory-for-includes) or [Layouts](</docs/config/#directory-for-layouts-(optional)>) directories, a full build will run. {% addedin "2.0.0-canary.21" %}Files used as Eleventy Layouts in your build are exempted.
  - **Collections** {% addedin "2.0.0-canary.21" %}
    - When you add or delete a tag from a template, any templates using that collection tag (as declared by [`pagination.data`](/docs/pagination/) or [`eleventyImport.collections`](/docs/collections/#declare-your-collections-for-incremental-builds)) will be rebuilt.
- [**Passthrough Copy**](/docs/copy/)
  - {% addedin "0.11.0" %} Incremental passthrough copy uses the following rules:
    - Only copy a passthrough copy file when it actively changed. Donâ€™t run a template build if only a passthrough copy file has changed.
    - If a template has changed, donâ€™t copy the passthrough copy files.
    - There was some discussion about making this behavior default at [Issue #1109](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1109).
  - {% addedin "2.0.0-canary.12" %} [Passthrough copy can be emulated during `--serve`](/docs/copy/#passthrough-during-serve) to speed up both incremental and non-incremental builds.
- **Configuration File**
  - If you create/update your Eleventy configuration file, a full build will run.
- **Donâ€™t build on startup**: {% addedin "2.0.0-canary.25" %} [`--ignore-initial`](/docs/usage/#ignore-initial-to-run-eleventy-without-an-initial-build) was added and works great with `--incremental`.

## Additional Template Language Features

The previously stated incremental features are implemented in Eleventy core and are available to all template languages. Some template types offer additional `--incremental` build support:

- [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/): deep knowledge of the full component dependency graph allows us to smartly build templates that use a component when that component is changed.

## ðŸ—“ To Do

- **Cold Start Incremental**: `--incremental` does a full build to start out to provide a fresh starting point to work from. This feature would save the state of the build to the file system for faster cold starts. [Issue #984](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/984)
- **Incremental on a Build Server**: Cache the output folder between builds on a CI server like Netlify and only process/write templates that have changed since the last build. [Issue #2775](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/2775)
- Global/directory/template Data file usage mapped to templates (would give some improvements to serverless too) [Issue #2706](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/2706)
- Template types
  - `11ty.js`: Map JavaScript dependencies
  - `liquid`: Dependency mapping for Liquid templates (`{% raw %}{% include %}{% endraw %}`, etc)
  - ~~Dependency mapping for Nunjucks templates (`{% raw %}{% include %}{% endraw %}`, etc)~~ Unlikely due to Nunjucks API limitations.
- Collections dependencies improvements: while we have `eleventyImport.collections` to declaratively log collections dependencies, we may be able to dive deeper into template syntax APIs to find the symbols in use. [Issue #1615](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1615) Alternatively we may be able to change the collections API to use Proxies to get smarter about this in an easier way (though previous experiments with this for `eleventyComputed` failed in some languages).
- [Render plugin](/docs/plugins/render/): `{% raw %}{% renderFile %}{% endraw %}` dependencies
- _Stretch goal_: Pagination-level incremental that operates on a subset of data [Issue #1087](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues/1087)
