# Serverless

{% callout "error" %}<strong>Feature Removal</strong>: Per the <a href="/blog/community-survey-results/#which-official-plugins-do-you-use-in-your-projects">results of our Eleventy Community Survey 2023</a> (and announced in our <a href="/blog/canary-eleventy-v3/">first alpha</a> and <a href="/blog/three-point-oh-beta-one/">beta releases</a>), this feature was removed in Eleventy 3.0. You can go back to the <a href="https://v2.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/serverless/">v2 documentation</a> or create your <a href="/docs/programmatic/">own serverless bundle using the Eleventy programmatic API</a>.{% endcallout %}
