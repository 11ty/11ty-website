# Accessibility Statement

The Eleventy project recognizes that Accessibility is an incredibly important baseline to developing inclusive and quality software. On Eleventy web properties specifically, we aim to meet [WCAG 2.1 AA standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) and to support our development community to do the same.

If you’ve encountered an issue with our web site—accessibility or otherwise—please let us know! The best way to do this is filing a [new GitHub issue on the `11ty-website` repository](https://github.com/11ty/11ty-website/issues).

We are also available on Twitter at [{% avatarlocalcache "twitter", "eleven_ty" %}@eleven_ty](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty) or feel free to contact [{% communityavatar "zachleat" %}@zachleat directly](https://twitter.com/zachleat).

Our [Eleventy Leaderboards](/speedlify/) encourage best practices on sites that were Built with Eleventy through performance and accessibility auditing (via Lighthouse and axe) but automated auditing systems are only a starting point.

It’s very important that we take responsibility for the code we publish and deliver and strive to correct accessibility issues with the same veracity as a full service outage.
