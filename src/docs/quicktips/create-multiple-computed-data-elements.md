You can generate multiple data cascade elements in one `eleventyComputed.js` file. Following is a working example.

This example generates data cascade elements from multiple `.json` files in the global data directory.

Assume you have data files named `links.json` and `copyrights.json`, and you only want to extract a portion of the json object. In this case, the `entry` element contains the useful data in the json object, and is a child of the `feed` element in this case.

The corresponding `eleventyComputed.js` file contents can look like the following:

<div class="codetitle codetitle-right-md">_data/eleventyComputed.js</div>
{% set codeContent %}
export default {
	myCopyrights: (data) => {
		return data.copyrights.feed.entry;
	},
	myLinks: (data) => {
		return data.links.feed.entry;
	},
};
{% endset %}
