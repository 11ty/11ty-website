# {{ "Eleventy is a simpler static site generator." | orphanWrap | safe }}

Eleventy quickly builds speedy web sites. Originally pitched as the JavaScript alternative to Jekyll, Eleventy has matured into a [popular](/blog/four-million/) modern web site generator.

* Eleventy is **production ready** and trusted by: {% include "logos.njk" %}
* Eleventy is **<a href="/docs/glossary/#zero-config" class="buzzword">zero-config</a>** (by default) with flexible configuration options.
* Eleventy uses **independent template languages**. We donâ€™t want to hold your content hostage with a custom format. If you decide to use a different syntax later, having your content decoupled in this way will make migration easier.
* Eleventy **works with multiple template languages**. You can pick one or use them all together in a single project:

{% templatelangs templatetypes, page %}

* Eleventy is **not a JavaScript framework**â€”that means *zero boilerplate client-side JavaScript*. Weâ€™re **thinking long-term** to opt-out of the framework rat race. The tool chain, modules, and components you use in your front end stack are decoupled from this tool. Work from a solid foundation of <a href="/docs/glossary/#pre-rendered-templates-by-default" class="buzzword">pre-rendered templates</a> that suit your projectâ€™s <a href="/docs/glossary/#progressive-enhancement" class="buzzword">progressive enhancement</a> baseline requirements.
* Eleventy **works with your projectâ€™s existing directory structure** and allows **incremental adoption**. You donâ€™t need to start an Eleventy project from scratch. Eleventy is flexible enough to allow conversion of only a few templates at a time. Migrate as fast or as slow as youâ€™d like.
* Eleventy **works great with data**â€”use front matter and/or load from an API using data files to inject into your templates.
