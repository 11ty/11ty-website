# Using Data

Data can be used on a template from multiple different sources.

* [Configure your Templates](/docs/data-configuration/): Set data to configure how your template behaves in Eleventy.
* [Eleventy Supplied Data](/docs/data-eleventy-supplied/): Use data that Eleventy provides to you.
* Set your own data anywhere in the [Data Cascade](/docs/data-cascade/) to render in your templates.
