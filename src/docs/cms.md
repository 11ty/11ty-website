# Using a CMS

{% tableofcontents %}

_Content Management Systems_ (CMS) add a web-based interface to your site, allowing both technical and non-technical folks the ability to easily update the web site on-the-go.

Eleventy (like most site generators) is not tightly coupled to any specific CMS and offers the flexibility to work with a wide variety of available industry and community options! Content Management Systems decoupled in this way are known as _Headless_.

Using a Headless CMS offers a variety of benefits that will be immediately recognizable to developers familiar with more tightly-coupled/monolithic options, where the front and back-end are co-dependent on each other.

Primarily, using Headless allows developers more control over the front-end. This alleviates pressure on front-end performance and accessibility issues common to monolithic options. It’s worth noting that traditionally tightly-coupled solutions like Drupal, Joomla, or WordPress are also starting to offer Headless options too.

## Types of Headless

Digging deeper, there are two main types of Headless CMS options:

1. **Source Control**: checks files directly into your code repository (`git` is a very popular one). You may hear these referred to as Git-based CMS solutions. A few benefits of this approach:
   - Your data and content are already versioned.
   - Works as-is with your existing deployment process, including branch/test/pre-production deploy previews.
   - No data migration is needed if you decide to swap providers—it’s [baked in (not fried)](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000404).
1. **API Based**: provide an external API that can be queried in your build or serverless functions. This approach gives you access to a powerful query language that can unlock access to complex data structures.

## Headless CMS Providers

<div class="sites-vert sites-vert--md sites--reverse sites--center">
  <div class="lo-grid" style="--fl-gap-v: 5em;">
{%- for site in cmses | shuffle %}
{% include "site-card.njk" %}
{%- endfor %}
  </div>
</div>

_The list above is not meant to be exhaustive._
