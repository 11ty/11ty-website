# Opening a Terminal Window

{% tableofcontents %}

Eleventy runs in a [Terminal window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator). If you’re not familiar with Terminal windows, they’re used to run typed commands (and programs) on your computer. A Terminal window is mostly synonymous with terms like Command Line Interface (CLI) or shell prompt.

Here’s how to open a Terminal window in various operating systems:

## Mac OS

Mac OS includes an Application called `Terminal.app` which can be used to run Eleventy. Depending on your version of Mac OS, it may be in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`.

## Windows

Depending on your version of Windows, it may include the `Terminal` App (aka Windows PowerShell), the `Command Prompt` (also known as `cmd.exe`), or both.
