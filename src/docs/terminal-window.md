# Opening a Terminal

{% tableofcontents %}

Eleventy runs in a [Terminal application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator). If you’re not familiar with Terminal applications, they’re used to run typed commands (and programs) on your computer. A Terminal application is mostly synonymous with terms like Command Line Interface (CLI) or shell prompt.

Here’s how to open a Terminal in various operating systems:

## macOS

macOS includes an application called `Terminal` which can be used to run Eleventy. Depending on your version of macOS, it likely lives in `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal`. It may also be called `Terminal.app` if your operating system is configured to show file extensions.

## Windows

Depending on your version of Windows, it may include the `Terminal` application (aka Windows PowerShell, preferred), or the `Command Prompt` (also known as `cmd.exe`, not preferred), or both.

For the best terminal experience, we recommend installing [PowerShell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) on your Windows machine, a newer and more future-compatible terminal application (also newly cross-platform!).

## Linux

Depending on your flavor of Linux, it may be called `Terminal`, `Shell`, `Gnome Terminal`, `Konsole`, or `XTerm`.

## Editors

Some code editors bundle a terminal for you!

- [Nova](https://nova.app/) (macOS)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (macOS, Windows, Linux)
  - On Windows, Visual Studio Code is bundled with Windows Powershell.
- [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) (macOS, Windows, Linux)
