Runtime API Services are as-is services provided and hosted by 11ty. We officially host instances and also provide the source code for them so that you can self-host. The hosted instances are provided as-is without uptime guarantees.

It is encouraged to self-host these so you arenâ€™t relying on run-time services that are out of your control but you can assess the risk-reward of this scenario yourself. (Definitely self-host for business use cases)
