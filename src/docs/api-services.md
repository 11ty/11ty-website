API Services are run-time things that are provided by Eleventy. We officially host instances of these and provide the source code for them so that you can self-host. The hosted instances are provided as-is without uptime guarantees.

It is encouraged to self-host these so you arenâ€™t relying on run-time services that are out of your control but you can assess the risk-reward of this scenario yourself. (Definitely self-host for business use cases)

## [Eleventy API Explorer](https://api-explorer.11ty.dev/)

This is a website to show sample results from the official Eleventy API services.
