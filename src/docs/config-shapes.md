# Configuration Shapes

You can learn more about the [default file names for configuration files](/docs/config.md#default-filenames).

## Callback Function

**Callback functions are the preferred method** for configuration files and allow you further customization options using Eleventyâ€™s full Configuration API helper methods.

{% addedin "3.0.0-alpha.1" %}Support for ESM and Asynchronous callbacks was added in Eleventy v3.0.

{% include "config/config-shape-callback.njk" %}

### Optional: Export `config` Object

{% include "config/config-shape-callback-export.njk" %}

### Optional: Return Object

Instead of exporting a `config` object with your static options, you _can_ return this same object in your configuration callback (though it is **not preferred** for order-of-operations reasons).

{% include "config/config-shape-returnobj.njk" %}

## Export Default Object

You _can_ export your static options as the top level default export too, though configuration **[callback functions](#callback-function) are preferred** as they allow you to access the full Configuration API.

{% include "config/config-shape-exportobj.njk" %}
