# Internationalization (I18n)

{% tableofcontents %}

{% callout "info", "md" %}**This page is a companion to the [Internationalization (I18n) plugin page](/docs/plugins/i18n/).**{% endcallout %}

There are two big decisions you’ll need to make up front when working on an Eleventy project that serves localized content:

1. File Organization
2. URL Style

Note that Eleventy works with a variety of third-party JavaScript libraries for organizing and localizing strings, numbers, dates, etc. A few popular choices include:

- [`eleventy-plugin-i18n`](https://github.com/adamduncan/eleventy-plugin-i18n)
- [`rosetta`](https://github.com/lukeed/rosetta)
- [`i18next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next)
- [`y18n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/y18n)
- [`intl-messageformat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intl-messageformat)
- [LinguiJS](https://lingui.js.org/tutorials/javascript.html).

## How to organize your files

Most folks like to create a folder for each locale they want to serve in their project. This is by-far the most [popular approach]({{ "https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1545436046527184896" | canonicalTwitterUrl }}) for most folks (and works best with Eleventy’s [Data Cascade](/docs/data-cascade/) and default [permalink setup](/docs/permalinks/) too).

This usually involves a directory structure something like this:

```
📁 en -> 📄 about.html
📁 es -> 📄 about.html
📁 de -> 📄 about.html
📁 ja -> 📄 about.html
📂 and so on…
```

This allows you to use Eleventy’s [Data Cascade](/docs/data-cascade/) with [directory data files](/docs/data-template-dir/) to set data for the entire language directory. For example, `/en/en.json` with `{"lang": "en"}` and `/es/es.json` with `{"lang": "es"}` will make the `lang` variable available to all templates (even deeply nested) inside of the directory.

Alternatively (and much less popularly) some projects like to denote the language code in each individual file name:

```
📄 about.en.html
📄 about.es.html
📄 and so on…
```

The latter method is more unwieldy and not recommended (but [still achievable with some `permalink` wrangling](/docs/permalinks/#mapping-one-url-to-multiple-files-for-internationalization)).

## Choose your URL style

1. Distinct URLs, e.g. `/en/about/` and `/es/about/`
2. Content negotiation, e.g. `/about/`

This choice is a [bit more contentious]({{ "https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1544792312949063680" | canonicalTwitterUrl }}). There are benefits and drawbacks to both methods. Some folks even mix the two approaches within a single project!

### Distinct URLs

- Pro: Every piece of content is uniquely addressable, linkable, and cacheable.
- Pro: Easy to statically host and works with few (if-any) internal redirects.
- Con: Internal link URLs must be normalized on shared content (navigation and footer links).
  - e.g. `/es/about/` should link to other `/es/` pages.
  - Use the `locale_url` filter from Eleventy’s [Internationalization plugin](/docs/plugins/i18n/).
- Con: When a URL mismatches with an end user’s language preference (as specified in a language chooser widget or the `Accept-Language` request header in the browser), a redirect is _suggested_ (but not required!). This is a subtle but important point that when using URLs the ultimate control is left in the hands of the end user.
  - Use the `locale_links` filter from Eleventy’s [Internationalization plugin](/docs/plugins/i18n/) to show the available relevant localized content for a specific file.

### Content Negotiation

- Pro: URLs don’t need to be transformed and the appropriate content is selected (via a rewrite) on the server.
- Pro: Redirects are not necessary to respect end user preferences.
- Con: Requires _some_ server configuration to handle the `Accept-Language` header and rewrite correctly.
- Con: To view another localized version of a piece of content, you will _need_ to rely on the user’s web browser preferences (`Accept-Language` request header) or implement a language override widget. End users subsequently have less control.

### Example Netlify Redirects

<style>
#preformatted-code-menu code {
  white-space: pre;
}
</style>
<div id="preformatted-code-menu">

- `/en/  /en/blog/   /es/blog/` [_Distinct URLs_](#distinct-urls-for-all-pages)
- `/     /blog/      /es/blog/` [_Distinct URLs with an implied default language_](#distinct-urls-using-implied-default-language)
- `/     /blog/      /blog/   ` [_Content Negotiation_](#content-negotiation-on-all-pages)
- `/     /en/blog/   /es/blog/` [_Content Negotiation on `/` only_](#content-negotiation-on-/-only)

</div>

To implement the above methods, you can use [Netlify’s Redirects and Rewrites features](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) (or [Netlify Edge Functions](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) for more advanced use cases).

In the examples below, English (`en`) is the default fallback language and Spanish (`es`) is an additionally supported language. To add more languages, repeat each entry for Spanish (`es`) and change the language code.

#### Content Negotiation on all pages

_No language codes in URLs:_

<is-land on:visible import="/js/seven-minute-tabs.js">
<seven-minute-tabs>
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Choose a template language">
    View:
    <a href="#i18n-cnall-redirects" role="tab">_redirects</a>
    <a href="#i18n-cnall-toml" role="tab">netlify.toml</a>
  </div>
  <div id="i18n-cnall-redirects" role="tabpanel">

```
# Redirect any URLs with the language code in them already
/es/*   /:splat     301!
/en/*   /:splat     301!

# Show the language-specific content file
/*      /es/:splat  200   Language=es
/*      /en/:splat  200
```

  </div>
  <div id="i18n-cnall-toml" role="tabpanel">

```toml
# Redirect any URLs with the language code in them already
[[redirects]]
  from = "/es/*"
  to = "/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

[[redirects]]
  from = "/en/*"
  to = "/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

# Show the language-specific content file
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/es/:splat"
  status = 200
  conditions = {Language = ["es"]}

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/en/:splat"
  status = 200
```

  </div>
</seven-minute-tabs>
</is-land>

#### Distinct URLs for all pages

_URLs should always have language codes in them._

These redirects are specifically for content that is missing a language code in the URL (e.g. `/` redirect to `/en/`). To avoid a redirect on the home page (recommended) use [Content Negotiation on `/` only](#content-negotiation-on-/-only).

<is-land on:visible import="/js/seven-minute-tabs.js">
<seven-minute-tabs>
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Choose a template language">
    View:
    <a href="#i18n-distinct-redirects" role="tab">_redirects</a>
    <a href="#i18n-distinct-toml" role="tab">netlify.toml</a>
  </div>
  <div id="i18n-distinct-redirects" role="tabpanel">

```
# Important: Per shadowing rules, URLs for the language-specific
# content files are served without redirects.

# Redirect for end-user’s browser preference override
/*  /es/:splat  302   Language=es

# Default
/*  /en/:splat  302
```

  </div>
  <div id="i18n-distinct-toml" role="tabpanel">

```toml
# Important: Per shadowing rules (force = false) URLs for the
# language-specific content files are served without redirects.

# Redirect for end-user’s browser preference override
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/es/:splat"
  status = 302
  conditions = {Language = ["es"]}

# Default
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/en/:splat"
  status = 302
```

  </div>
</seven-minute-tabs>
</is-land>

Make sure you read the [Netlify shadowing rules](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/rewrites-proxies/#shadowing) to understand why `/es/*` and `/en/*` URLs are _not_ redirected.

#### Content Negotiation on `/` only

_Every URL but the home page should have a language codes in it._

This uses content negotiation for your home page and distinct URLs for everything else (it uses the redirects from both methods above). This mixed approach has the benefit of _avoiding_ a top level redirect on your home page (e.g. from `/` to `/en/`).

<is-land on:visible import="/js/seven-minute-tabs.js">
<seven-minute-tabs>
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Choose a template language">
    View:
    <a href="#i18n-cn-redirects" role="tab">_redirects</a>
    <a href="#i18n-cn-toml" role="tab">netlify.toml</a>
  </div>
  <div id="i18n-cn-redirects" role="tabpanel">

```
/   /es/        200   Language=es
/   /en/        200
/*  /es/:splat  302   Language=es
/*  /en/:splat  302
```

  </div>
  <div id="i18n-cn-toml" role="tabpanel">

```toml
# Content negotiation for home page
[[redirects]]
  from = "/"
  to = "/es/"
  status = 200
  conditions = {Language = ["es"]}

# Content negotiation for home page
[[redirects]]
  from = "/"
  to = "/en/"
  status = 200

# Redirect for end-user’s browser preference override
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/es/:splat"
  status = 302
  conditions = {Language = ["es"]}

# Default
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/en/:splat"
  status = 302
```

  </div>
</seven-minute-tabs>
</is-land>

#### Distinct URLs using Implied Default Language

_Only non-default languages should include the language code in the URLs._

This approach leaves off the language code in URLs for the default language. Non-default languages include the language code in the URL (e.g. `/` for English and `/es/` for Spanish).

<is-land on:visible import="/js/seven-minute-tabs.js">
<seven-minute-tabs>
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Choose a template language">
    View:
    <a href="#i18n-distinctimplied-redirects" role="tab">_redirects</a>
    <a href="#i18n-distinctimplied-toml" role="tab">netlify.toml</a>
  </div>
  <div id="i18n-distinctimplied-redirects" role="tabpanel">

```
# Redirect any URLs with the language code in them already
/en/*   /:splat     301!

# Important: Per shadowing rules, URLs for the
# _non-default_ language-specific content files
# are served without redirects.

# Redirect for end-user’s browser preference override
/*      /es/:splat  302   Language=es
/*      /en/:splat  200
```

  </div>
  <div id="i18n-distinctimplied-toml" role="tabpanel">

```toml
# Redirect any URLs with the language code in them already
[[redirects]]
  from = "/en/*"
  to = "/:splat"
  status = 301
  force = true

# Important: Per shadowing rules, URLs for the
# _non-default_ language-specific content files
# are served without redirects.

# Redirect for end-user’s browser preference override
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/es/:splat"
  status = 302
  conditions = {Language = ["es"]}

# Default
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/en/:splat"
  status = 200
```

  </div>
</seven-minute-tabs>
</is-land>
