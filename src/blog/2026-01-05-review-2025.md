It was _another huge_ year for 11ty. We shipped _177 releases_ (73% more than 2024). We closed 804 issues (15% more than 2024). We reduced our [dependency count by 28% and weight by 22%](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/dependency-watch/). More folks are building with Eleventy than ever: our year-over-year npm downloads are up by 51%! **Eight years into this roller coaster of an open source project and it still feels like we’re just getting started!**

## Highlights

Here is a small, curated collection of 2025 highlights:

- In April, we moved to our [own Mastodon server](https://neighborhood.11ty.dev/@11ty). Also the [amazing Eleventy LibDoc community starter project](https://eleventy-libdoc.netlify.app/) first shipped!
- In May, we shipped a sizeable [v3.1.0 release](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.1.0) focused on reducing dependencies and improving build performance! We also shipped an [interactive playground component to the docs](https://neighborhood.11ty.dev/@11ty/114519676689929120) (Eleventy in the browser!).
- In June, we were featured in a [video on the Veronica Explains YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_bYUVGgQQo)!
- In July, we started [shipping 4.x alpha pre-releases](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/versions/)!
- In August, I found an [old note from my late grandmother about the origins of the Eleventy name](https://www.zachleat.com/web/history-of-eleventy-name/).
- In September, we found our [logo added to the Font Awesome v7 icon set](https://neighborhood.11ty.dev/@11ty/115226254940993358)!
- In October, we changed the docs [supporter facepile to include emeritus individual supporters](https://www.zachleat.com/web/permanent-eleventy-facepile/) and shamefully [added long-awaited copy-paste buttons](https://www.zachleat.com/web/copy-paste/).
- In November, we [rehauled how we use GitHub Issues](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/github-issues/) and made a bunch of long-overdue progress on our Issue tracker. [Estela Franco also showed us their Eleventy source code backpack](https://neighborhood.11ty.dev/@guaca@toot.cafe/115553703597032584)
- In December, we [improved our security footprint by eliminating Access Tokens from our npm package publishing process](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/npm-security/).
	- We simplified our historical docs by centralizing to [v0, v1, v2, and v3 subdomains](https://neighborhood.11ty.dev/@11ty/115663215128943589).
	- We improved the docs for [different flavors of JavaScript](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/cjs-esm/) (CommonJS, ESM, and TypeScript) to use in Eleventy (including guidance on Node’s new type stripping features).
- With a special sustained community nod to the [×17 11ty Bundle Newsletters](https://11tybundle.dev/blog/) and [×8 11ty Meetups](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/) that happened in 2025!
