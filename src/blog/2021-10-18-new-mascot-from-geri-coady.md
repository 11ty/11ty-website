The Eleventy Mascot is becoming a series! Our project has continued with its pseudo-regular refresh of the famed possum on a balloon and the latest in the series is from acclaimed designer, illustrator, and author Geri Coady!

<div style="display: inline-block; border-radius: 1em; background-color: hsl(229deg 40% 38%); border: .75em solid hsl(229deg 40% 28%); box-shadow: -10px 10px 80px rgb(0 0 0 / 10%);">

</div>

I really like this iteration and the unique style Geri brought to the project—especially the addition of two littles, which to me is a lovely nod to how our community has grown!
