### Check out the [Jamstack Community Survey 2021](https://jamstack.org/survey/2021/)

Skip to the [Technology choices section](https://jamstack.org/survey/2021/#choices) to read about Frameworks.

Of note:

> Major frameworks, where the cut-off is at least 10% usage

Eleventy is classified as a “major framework” here with ~17% usage, which is huge news. Our usage is beyond that of Vite, Svelte, Hugo, Preact, and Jekyll in the Jamstack world!

> Relative newcomers Svelte and 11ty are doing very well, with 11ty continuing a strong showing despite relatively low awareness. Early-ish adopters, check these out.

Astute readers might remember that [last year’s 2020 survey](/blog/jamstack-survey/) had some lovely things to say too.

Really appreciate the support, everyone!
