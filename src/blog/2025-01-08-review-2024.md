## Highlights
It was a _huge_ year for 11ty. The top three highlights have been:

- In October, [**Eleventy 3.0** stable shipped](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0) with so many new features, notably unlocking the optional use of ESM in your Eleventy projects.
- In September, [**11ty Joined Font Awesome**](/blog/eleventy-font-awesome/) and it’s been a wildly productive and beautiful partnership! If you’re interested, [we talked about it on Podcast Awesome](https://www.podcastawesome.com/2092855/episodes/16065652-nerd-show-and-tell-meet-zach-leatherman).
- In May, we ran the [**11ty Conference**](https://conf.11ty.dev/) and it was an incredible success! You can read an [organizer’s retrospective on my personal blog](https://www.zachleat.com/web/11ty-conf-retro/). All of [the conference videos are on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhCq3ZFGOGgetCSWisU2pkl9AFwQVxWJ). Alongside the conference, we launched a [limited time Merch store](https://merch.11ty.dev/) and an [Email Newsletter](https://buttondown.com/11ty).

Honorable mentions to [Eleventy on Wikipedia](/blog/wikipedia/) and Eleventy in use at [The Louvre Museum](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy/113624974799156967) ([among others](/#why-should-you-use-eleventy)).

## Metrics

I’ve started a little spreadsheet of data points from the 11ty ecosystem. I started doing this in early 2024 so some of the data is a bit incomplete (but noted below).
