In order to minimize administrative overhead, to receive an Eleventy sticker you must find someone with Eleventy stickers and ask for one. Verbally. In person. They are not distributed on conference sticker tables. They are not mailed. They are not shipped. They travel only by sneakernet.

Our current list of Eleventy Sticker Ambassadors includes:

* [{% avatarlocalcache "twitter", "zachleat" %}Zach Leatherman](https://zachleat.com/) (👋🏻 hi)
* [{% avatarlocalcache "twitter", "mmatuzo" %}Manuel Matuzović](https://www.matuzo.at/)

This list of Sticker Ambassadors may expand as time goes on. You will need to find out which meetups/conferences/events our Sticker Ambassadors are going to, attend those events, and _talk to them_! As an introvert, I know this is terrible (sorry).
