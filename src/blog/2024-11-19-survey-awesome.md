{% callout %}The survey is now closed!{% endcallout %}

In the past we have used [The Eleventy Community Survey](/blog/community-survey/) to help guide and focus our project’s priorities using feedback from the community. This was immensely useful data and helped inform a lot of long-term decision making for the project, providing good insights on various industry trends.

As [11ty joined Font Awesome](/blog/eleventy-font-awesome/) a few short months ago, our project is again relying on survey results to inform future priorities and focus. Alongside the Font Awesome folks, we’re giving the 11ty Community a first look at [<del>**Survey Awesome**</del>]({{ external_url }})—a larger and more comprehensive survey about how folks are building for the web, start to end.

If ever you wanted a say in future projects and priorities in the 11ty Ecosystem, now is the time to weigh in. Help us by [<del>adding your voice to **Survey Awesome** today</del>]({{ external_url }})!
