In the past we have used [The Eleventy Community Survey](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/community-survey/) to help guide and focus our project’s priorities using feedback from the community. This was immensely useful data and helped inform a lot of long-term decision making for the project, providing good insights on various industry trends.

As [11ty joined Font Awesome](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-font-awesome/) a few short months ago, our project is again relying on survey results to inform future priorities and focus. Alongside the Font Awesome folks, we’re giving the 11ty Community a first look at [**Survey Awesome**](https://survey.awesome.me/?from=11ty)—a larger and more comprehensive survey about how folks are building for the web, start to end.

If ever you wanted a say in future projects and priorities in the 11ty Ecosystem, now is the time to weigh in. Help us by [adding your voice to **Survey Awesome** today](https://survey.awesome.me/?from=11ty)!
