In May 2024 (this year!) we’ll gather together our _extremely-online_ community of webcraftspeople to share what we know! Join us at the [**11ty International Symposium on Making Web Sites Real Good**](https://conf.11ty.dev/).

We’ll publish a full schedule of relevant conference dates (call for proposals, et cetera) in the coming weeks!
