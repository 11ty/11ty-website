The [**11ty International Symposium on Making Web Sites Real Good**](https://conf.11ty.dev/) is happening on May 9, 2024 and we’ve been humbled by the response so far: 881 people already registered!

This week we’ve launched the [open call for talk proposals]({{ external_url }}). If you’re interested in speaking at the conference, you have about a month (until March 22) to add your submission(s):

</a>

We’re looking for talks on a variety of topics that will interest folks that care about the craft of building for the web: Best Practices That Work (CSS), Development Trends (e.g. Navigating the Great Divide), Jamstack, Front of the front end Development, Design Systems, Accessibility, Open Source, Web Performance (and probably some Eleventy too!).

If your submission is selected, you will receive a complimentary official 11ty Conference swag bag (it will likely contain stickers) and a small honorarium.

Appreciate you all and keep building for the web!
