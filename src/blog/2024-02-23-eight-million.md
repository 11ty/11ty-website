On February 19, 2024 **Eleventy passed [eight million lifetime downloads](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=%4011ty%2Feleventy&from=2018-01-01&to=2024-02-19)**!

{%- if npm and npm.downloads %} _That download count is now {{ npm.downloads | humanReadableNum }} (as of {{ config.now | newsDate }})._
{%- endif %}

_(This number is limited to Eleventy core and doesn’t count our ecosystem of utilities and plugins.)_
