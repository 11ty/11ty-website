### Check out the [Jamstack Community Survey 2022](https://jamstack.org/survey/2022/)

Looks like our usage grew from [17% to 19% while keeping a solid 3.8 satisfaction score](https://jamstack.org/survey/2022/#frameworks-by-usage-and-satisfaction).

Also notably:

> 11ty was the only purely static site generator (SSG) in our survey to show growth in usage share. For this reason we think 11ty is now the clear choice if a static site is your use case.

> As we mentioned already, if youâ€™re building a static or nearly-static site, we continue to think 11ty is an excellent choice given its growth relative to other SSGs in the space.

We really appreciate the support, everyone!
