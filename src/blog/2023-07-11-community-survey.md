Eleventy (like so many other projects and companies) is going through [a period of change](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-side-project/). To best inform our decisions—which may include deprecation or community-ownership of some of our plugins—we’re asking everyone to help out by participating in the [Eleventy Community Survey](https://forms.gle/zFA4Jno1cfT8nt9J8).

We’re received 440+ responses so far and the survey will remain open for just a few more days. After closing, we’ll share popularity metrics around favorite template languages, plugins, hosts, and integrations across the Possumverse.

Thank you!
