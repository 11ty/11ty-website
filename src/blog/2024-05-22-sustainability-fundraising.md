11ty is now operating independently, with full time development and maintenance funded by our Open Collective supporters. We need your help to keep going! We have a goal of $6000 USD recurring monthly budget.

Individual contributions are great (every bit helps) but we _need_ more businesses to help. We’re also open to corporate partners: Developer Tools, Web Hosting (Jamstack, Static Sites, et al), Image Optimization (we’re about to ship a best-in-class Image Optimization plugin that would pair quite nicely with a hosted service), Content Management Systems, and Web Performance and Monitoring.

* **Head directly to [our Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/11ty) to start your recurring donation.** We also accept [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/11ty).
* If you have questions or want to set up a chat to discuss an opportunity, [contact me directly](mailto:zach@11ty.dev)
