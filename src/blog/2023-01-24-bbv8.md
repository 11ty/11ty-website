Last week marked the [first beta release of Eleventy’s new v2.0 version](/blog/eleventy-v2-beta/). This week we’ve spent a little time updating our `eleventy-base-blog` project to the latest version and added a few new features too.

Here’s what the base blog now offers out of the box:

- Using [Eleventy v2.0](https://www.11ty.dev/blog/eleventy-v2-beta/) with the new [Eleventy Dev Server](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dev-server/) and that same great zero-JavaScript taste.
  - Can easily [deploy to a subfolder without changing any content](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/html-base/)
- **Performance focused**: four-hundos Lighthouse score out of the box!
  - **0 Cumulative Layout Shift** and **0ms Total Blocking Time**
  - [View the Lighthouse report for the latest demo build](https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/reports/lighthouse/) courtesy of the [Netlify Lighthouse plugin](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-plugin-lighthouse). Notably, the demo site fails the build if the site goes below a perfect four-hundos threshold.
- Content-driven navigation menu via the [Eleventy Navigation plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/navigation/)
- Automated image optimization (without client JavaScript) via the [Eleventy Image utility](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/)
  - Generate modern image formats automatically (e.g. AVIF and WebP)
  - Automated swap between `<img>` and `<picture>` dependent on how many output formats you’re using.
  - Markup is generated for you with `srcset` and optional `sizes`
  - Includes `width`/`height` attributes to avoid [content layout shift](https://web.dev/cls/).
  - Includes `loading="lazy"` for native lazy loading without JavaScript.
  - Includes [`decoding="async"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/decoding)
  - Images can be co-located with blog post files.
  - View the [Image plugin source code](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/blob/main/eleventy.config.images.js)
- Built-in [syntax highlighter](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/syntaxhighlight/) (no client JavaScript)
- Blog Posts
  - Draft posts: use `draft: true` to mark a blog post as a draft. Drafts are **only** included during `--serve`/`--watch` and are excluded from full builds. View the [Drafts plugin source code](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog/blob/main/eleventy.config.drafts.js).
  - Automated next/previous links
  - Accessible deep links to headings
- Generated Pages
  - Home, Archive, and About pages by default (configure more as needed!)
  - Customizable content not found (404) page
  - [Feeds for Atom and JSON](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/)
  - `sitemap.xml`
  - Zero-maintenance tag pages ([View on the Demo](https://eleventy-base-blog.netlify.app/tags/))
