As many of you may know, [James Williamson](/news/james-williamson/) first came up with _animal suspended from the floating red balloon_ logo for the Eleventy project in May of 2018.

It was [originally a cat](https://twitter.com/jameswillweb/status/999052022497316865)!

James’ [quickly iterated to the now-iconic Eleventy possum](https://twitter.com/jameswillweb/status/999059541798072320).

Why a possum? Why is the possum floating? Why a balloon? Exactly. _42._

To honor James, I thought it might be nice to commission a professional interpretation of his original vision. After [Ethan Marcotte shared some possum content from Phineas X. Jones](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1206687578382049284), I knew we had the artist to make this a reality.

Literally three days later, I am proud to show you all something that I hope James would have really enjoyed.
