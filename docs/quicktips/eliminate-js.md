Older iterations of this website used a third party JavaScript widget to show the number of GitHub Stars the project currently had. You can see it in action on the [versioned docs for 0.7.1](https://v0-7-1.11ty.io/docs/) (scroll to the bottom).

This was in fact the only `<script>` tag on the entire [11ty.io](https://www.11ty.io/) web site and it was from a third party. Naturally, it needed to be annihilated.

Letâ€™s change up our architecture to ruthlessly eliminate this client-side JavaScript.

## Get the Stargazers Count from the GitHub API

Read more at the [GitHub API documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get).

This is a bit different from our client-side implementation because this data is only as updated as often as your build runs. This is implemented using a global [JavaScript data file](/docs/data-js/) at `_data/github.js`.

* Install new dependencies: `npm install node-fetch --save-dev`
* Read more about [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch)

{% codetitle "_data/github.js" %}

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");

module.exports = async function() {
  console.log( "Fetching new github stargazers countâ€¦" );

  // GitHub API: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get
  return fetch("https://api.github.com/repos/11ty/eleventy")
    .then(res => res.json()) // node-fetch option to transform to json
    .then(json => {
      // prune the data to return only what we want
      return {
        stargazers: json.stargazers_count
      };
    });
};
```

Now in your templates you can output the stargazers count with:

{% codetitle "Liquid, Nunjucks", "Syntax" %}

{% raw %}
```html
{{ github.stargazers }} GitHub Stars
```
{% endraw %}

which outputs

```
1515 GitHub Stars
```

Bonus: I created a [`humanReadableNum` filter](https://github.com/11ty/11ty.io/blob/ac3579909078f860f4af1185c8f7353d56833c22/.eleventy.js#L82)) using the [`human-readable-numbers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/human-readable-numbers) package to format the number.

## More Examples

You can look in the footer of this page to see examples of this in use on this very web site. I used it for:

* [NPM Download Count](https://github.com/11ty/11ty.io/blob/ac3579909078f860f4af1185c8f7353d56833c22/_data/npm.js)
* [GitHub Stargazers Count](https://github.com/11ty/11ty.io/blob/ac3579909078f860f4af1185c8f7353d56833c22/_data/github.js)
* [Twitter Followers Count](https://github.com/11ty/11ty.io/blob/ac3579909078f860f4af1185c8f7353d56833c22/_data/twitter.js) (careful here, this one is super brittle but Twitterâ€™s API is historically anti-developer so ðŸ˜‡)

These all use the recommended caching mechanism described in the next section.

## Recommended: Cache the Data to the File System

If Iâ€™m working on my site locally, I probably donâ€™t want every Eleventy run to hit this external API call. Iâ€™d hit my rate limit pretty quickly (on GitHub, 60 per hour). Instead, letâ€™s use an npm package called [`flat-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flat-cache) to save our results locally to the file system and only run it once per day.

* Install dependencies: `npm install node-fetch flat-cache --save-dev`
* Read more about [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) and [`flat-cache`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flat-cache).

### Highlights:

* A `_datacache/github-stargazers` file is created that saves the results of the service call.
* The data is keyed off the current UTC date.
* If the data already exists in the cache (for the current UTC date), it uses the cached value instead of fetching new data.

{% codetitle "_data/github.js" %}

```js
const fetch = require("node-fetch");
const flatcache = require("flat-cache");
const path = require("path");

function getCacheKey() {
  let date = new Date();
  return `${date.getUTCFullYear()}-${date.getUTCMonth() + 1}-${date.getUTCDate()}`;
}

module.exports = async function() {
  let cache = flatcache.load("github-stargazers", path.resolve("./_datacache"));
  let key = getCacheKey();
  let cachedData = cache.getKey(key);
  if(!cachedData) {
    console.log( "Fetching new github stargazers countâ€¦" );

    // GitHub API: https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#get
    let newData = await fetch("https://api.github.com/repos/11ty/eleventy")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(json => {
        return {
          stargazers: json.stargazers_count
        };
      });

    cache.setKey(key, newData);
    cache.save();
    return newData;
  }

  return cachedData;
};
```

If you want to fetch data more frequently than once per day, modify `getCacheKey` to return more a specific date. Add an hour to the key to run every hour, for example:

```js
function getCacheKey() {
  let date = new Date();
  return `${date.getUTCFullYear()}-${date.getUTCMonth() + 1}-${date.getUTCDate()} ${date.getUTCHours()}`;
}
```

{% callout "info" %}Take note that if youâ€™re using this on a Netlify build, it will not maintain updates to the cache (as it resets the cache to the files that are checked into git) and will likely re-run every time.
<ul>
  <li>Current <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting">GitHub rate limits</a> are limited to 60 requests per hour, so this will only be a problem if you do more than 60 Netlify builds in an hour.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/164799520460/api-rate-limiting-rolling-out">npm API doesnâ€™t seem to have a hard limit</a>.</li>
</ul>{% endcallout %}
