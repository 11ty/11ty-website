# Getting Started

Eleventy requires Node.js version 8 or higher.

``` bash
npm install -g @11ty/eleventy
echo '# Page header' > README.md
eleventy
```

This will compile any files matching valid template file extensions in the current directory into the output folder (defaults to `_site`).

``` text
