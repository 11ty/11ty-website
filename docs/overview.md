## Eleventy is a simpler static site generator.

Eleventy was created to be a JavaScript alternative to Jekyll. It’s <a href="/docs/resources/#zero-config" class="buzzword">zero-config</a> by default but has flexible configuration options. Eleventy **works with your project’s existing directory structure.**

Eleventy uses **independent template engines**. We don’t want to hold your content hostage. If you decide to use something else later, having your content decoupled in this way will make migration easier.

Eleventy **works with multiple template languages**. You can pick one or use them all together in a single project:

<ul class="inlinelist">
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>Markdown</li>
  <li>Liquid</li>
  <li>Nunjucks</li>
  <li>Handlebars</li>
  <li>Mustache</li>
  <li>EJS</li>
  <li>Haml</li>
  <li>Pug</li>
  <li>JavaScript Template Literals</li>
</ul>

Eleventy is **not a JavaScript framework**—that means *zero boilerplate client-side JavaScript*. We’re thinking long term and opting out of the framework rat race. The tool chain, code conventions, and modules you use in your front end stack are decoupled from this tool. Work from a solid foundation of <a href="/docs/resources/#pre-rendered-templates" class="buzzword">pre-rendered templates</a> that suit your project’s <a href="/docs/resources/#progressive-enhancement" class="buzzword">progressive enhancement</a> baseline requirements.

Eleventy **works great with data**—use both front matter and external data files to inject content into templates.

## Happy Developers

> “Seriously can't remember enjoying using a Static Site Generator this much. Yes Hugo is rapid, but this is all so logical. It feels like it was designed by someone who has been through lots of pain and success using other SSGs.”—[Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth)

> “Don’t tell Zach I said it but Eleventy is seeming fresh as hell so far”—[Mat Marquis](https://twitter.com/wilto)

> “Just go through moving a project to Eleventy. Never used nunjucks or a static site generator before, but it was so easy. This will make my life so much easier.”—[Micah Mills](https://twitter.com/micahmills/status/973660230453211136)

> “After a day or so tweaking my existing build, here is a preview of the site running on Eleventy. I'm sold! The main thing to me was the ability to run custom JavaScript logic to sort, filter, and augment data in collections.”—[Eduardo Bouças](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas/status/1001158411583721473)

> “Every time I make something with Eleventy it makes me smile. I think that might be to do with its focus on simplicity.”—[Phil Hawksworth](https://twitter.com/philhawksworth/status/998891176550977537) (again)

> “I really like the flexibity Eleventy offers in comparision to my previous Jekyll build.”—[Alex Carpenter](https://alexcarpenter.me/posts/2018/05/back-to-static)

> “I've been digging into Eleventy, a new static site generator. Really like the way it handles pagination!”—[James Williamson](https://twitter.com/jameswillweb/status/951488360543121408)

> “I tried Eleventy last night on a personal project and today we implemented it on a (non-public facing) client project. It's really good.”—[Cody Peterson](https://twitter.com/codypeterson/status/950568228559904768)
