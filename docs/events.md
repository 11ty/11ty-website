# Events

You may want to run some code at certain times during the compiling process. To do that, you can use _configuration events_, which will run at specific times during the compiling process.

[[toc]]

All events are configured in your `.eleventy.js` configuration file, with the code run every time the event triggers.

## beforeBuild {% addedin "0.11.1" %}

The `beforeBuild` event runs every time Eleventy starts building, so it will run before the start of each stand-alone build, as well as each time building starts as either part of `--watch` or `--serve`. To use it, attach the event handler to your Eleventy config:

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.on('beforeBuild', () => {
    // Run me before the build starts
  });
};
```

## afterBuild {% addedin "0.11.1" %}

The `afterBuild` event runs every time Eleventy finishes building, so it will run after the end of each stand-alone build, as well as each time building ends as either part of `--watch` or `--serve`. To use it, attach the event handler to your Eleventy config:

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.on('afterBuild', () => {
    // Run me after the build ends
  });
};
```

## beforeWatch {% addedin "0.11.0" %}

The `beforeWatch` event runs before a build is run _only_ if it's a re-run during `--watch` or `--serve`. This means it will neither run during the initial build nor during stand-alone builds. To use it, attach the event handler to your Eleventy config:

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.on('beforeWatch', () => {
    // Run me before --watch or --serve re-runs
  });
};
```

### Changed Files {% addedin "0.11.1" %}

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  eleventyConfig.on('beforeWatch', (changedFiles) => {
    // changedFiles is an array of files that changed
    // to trigger the watch/serve build
  });
};
```
