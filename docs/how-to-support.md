## <span class="numberflag"><span class="sr-only">Step</span> {{ count }}</span> Participate

* **Build something**‚Äîjoin the [{{ sites | getsize }} sites Built With Eleventy](/docs/sites/). Hopefully you‚Äôre doing this already, if you‚Äôre here reading the documentation.
* **Help answer questions**: We welcome questions from people of all experience levels on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues). We also welcome help answering those questions too!
* **Tell a friend!** Our project doesn‚Äôt have a big venture-capital backed marketing budget so we rely on word of mouth recommendations.

Eleventy isn‚Äôt backed by rich venture capitalists. It‚Äôs supported by individuals <strong>like {% emoji "üëã" %} <span class="nowrap" data-investors-avatar="prepend">you</span></strong> that want to invest in better, longer lasting tools to create on the web.

1. Provide access to <a href="/docs/search/">on-site documentation Search</a>!
1. No advertisements, tag managers, or third party trackers on Eleventy documentation pages. (Okay, everyone gets this)
1. <em>More to come!</em>
<!-- 1. **Future Roadmap** Access to documentation offline (Progressive Web App). -->

</div><!-- /lo-c --></div><!-- /lo -->

## <span class="numberflag"><span class="sr-only">Step</span> {{ count }}</span> Web Monetization Using Coil

We‚Äôre participating in what we hope will be the future of standards-based Web Monetization. We‚Äôre using a `<meta>` tag on our site (_importantly, this means no hefty third party runtime overhead_). If you have the [Coil web browser extension installed and an active Coil subscription](https://coil.com/), we get a few cents when you visit the site. Read more about it on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/site-monetization-with-coil-and-removing-ads-for-supporters/).
