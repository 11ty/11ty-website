* **Build something** with Eleventy! Hopefully you‚Äôre already doing this, if you‚Äôre reading the documentation üòá.
* **Help answer questions**: We welcome questions from people of all experience levels on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/issues). We also welcome help answering those questions too!
* **Tell a friend!** Our project doesn‚Äôt have a big venture-capital backed marketing budget so we rely on word of mouth recommendations.

We‚Äôre participating in what we hope will be the future of standards-based Web Monetization. We‚Äôre using a `<meta>` tag on our site (_importantly, this means no hefty third party runtime overhead_). If you have the [Coil web browser extension installed and an active Coil subscription](https://coil.com/), we get a few cents when you visit the site. Read more about it on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/site-monetization-with-coil-and-removing-ads-for-supporters/).
